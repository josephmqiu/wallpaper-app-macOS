# WallPaper App - AI Tools & Video Coding Test Project

**⚠️ This is a test project for experimenting with AI coding tools and video content creation. This is NOT a production-ready application.**

This macOS SwiftUI app was created as a learning experiment to test AI-assisted development workflows, explore SwiftUI patterns, and create content for video tutorials. The app demonstrates various iOS/macOS development concepts while serving as a practical example for educational purposes.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project serves multiple educational and testing purposes:
- **AI Tool Testing**: Experimenting with AI coding assistants for SwiftUI development
- **Video Content**: Creating educational content about macOS app development
- **Learning Exercise**: Exploring Steam Workshop API integration concepts
- **SwiftUI Practice**: Demonstrating modern SwiftUI patterns and best practices

## 📱 What This App Does

The WallPaper App is a conceptual wallpaper management application that demonstrates:

### Core Features (Conceptual)
- **Steam Workshop Integration**: Browse wallpapers from Steam Workshop (placeholder implementation)
- **AI Wallpaper Generation**: Generate wallpapers using AI prompts (placeholder implementation)
- **Local Management**: Download, organize, and manage wallpapers locally
- **Desktop Integration**: Set wallpapers as desktop background
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by tags, resolution, aspect ratio, and more
- **Smart Scheduling**: Automatically rotate wallpapers (placeholder implementation)

### UI Components
- **Tabbed Interface**: Browse, Downloads, and Settings tabs
- **Grid Layout**: Waterfall grid for wallpaper browsing
- **Detail Views**: Full-screen wallpaper preview with actions
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time search with tag-based filtering
- **Token Management**: Secure API key storage system

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Key Components

#### 1. **Data Layer**
- `WallpaperModel`: Core data structure for wallpaper information
- `SortingModels`: Enums for filtering and sorting options
- File-based token storage for API credentials

#### 2. **Service Layer**
- `APIService`: Handles network requests (currently placeholder)
- `TokenManager`: Manages Steam API token storage
- `WallpaperDownloadManager`: Handles file downloads
- `SteamClientManager`: Steam client integration

#### 3. **UI Layer**
- `ContentView`: Main tabbed interface
- `WallpaperGridView`: Grid display with filtering
- `DetailView`: Full-screen wallpaper preview
- `AIWizardView`: AI generation interface
- `DownloadedWallpapersView`: Local wallpaper management

#### 4. **Utility Layer**
- `CropAndSaveUtility`: Image processing (placeholder)
- `SchedulerManager`: Wallpaper rotation (placeholder)

### Data Flow
1. **App Launch**: Check for API token, prompt if missing
2. **Browse Wallpapers**: Load sample data (no real API calls)
3. **Filter/Sort**: Apply user-selected filters to sample data
4. **View Details**: Show full-resolution preview
5. **Download**: Save to local storage (simulated)
6. **Set Wallpaper**: Apply to desktop (simulated)

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### **This is NOT a Production App**
- **No Real API Integration**: All network calls are placeholders
- **Sample Data Only**: Uses hardcoded wallpaper examples
- **Simulated Features**: Many features are conceptual demonstrations
- **No Error Handling**: Limited error handling for edge cases
- **No Persistence**: Data is not saved between app launches

### **Technical Limitations**
- **Steam Workshop**: No actual Steam API integration
- **AI Generation**: No real AI image generation
- **File Operations**: Download and save operations are simulated
- **Background Tasks**: Scheduling features are not implemented
- **Image Processing**: Cropping and optimization are placeholders
- **iCloud Sync**: No cloud synchronization
- **Performance**: Not optimized for large datasets

### **UI/UX Limitations**
- **Limited Customization**: Basic theming only
- **No Animations**: Minimal transition animations
- **Accessibility**: Basic accessibility support
- **Localization**: Limited internationalization
- **Responsive Design**: Fixed layout assumptions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS 15.5 or later
- Xcode 15+ for development
- Basic Swift/SwiftUI knowledge

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `WallPaper App.xcodeproj` in Xcode
