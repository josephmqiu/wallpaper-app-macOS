# Production Improvements for Wallpaper App

This document outlines all the improvements made to move the Wallpaper App towards production readiness.

## 1. ✅ Advanced Filtering System

- **Implemented categorized filters** with dropdown menus:
  - **File Type**: Image, Video, GIF
  - **Resolution**: 1080p, 1440p, 4K, 5K, 8K
  - **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9, 21:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16
  - **Age Rating**: Everyone, Questionable, Mature
  - **Tags**: Dynamic based on loaded wallpapers

- **Created filter models** (`FilterModels.swift`):
  - `FilterCategory` enum for category management
  - `FilterOption` struct for individual filters

  - Smart filtering logic that allows single selection for some categories

## 2. ✅ API Token Management

  - Token persistence across app launches
  
- **Added token input UI** (`TokenInputView`):
  - Clean, native macOS design
  - Input validation
  - Link to Steam API key page
  - Shown automatically on first launch if no token exists

## 3. ✅ Sorting Functionality

- **Implemented comprehensive sorting options** (`SortingModels.swift`):
  - Date (Newest/Oldest)
  - Popularity (High/Low)
  - Downloads (High/Low)

  - Proper visual hierarchy

- **Enhanced visual design**:
  - Card-based layout with subtle shadows
  - Hover effects with scale and shadow changes
  - Improved badge design for content types
  - Better use of color and contrast

## 7. ✅ Code Quality Improvements

- **Better code organization**:
  - Separated concerns into dedicated files
  - Created utilities file for shared functions
  - Proper model separation

- **Improved error handling**:
  - Better API error messages
  - Token-specific error handling
  - User-friendly error displays

- **Performance optimizations**:
  - Efficient filtering with computed properties
  - Lazy loading in grids
  - Proper image caching with SDWebImage

## Additional Features Added

1. **Menu bar integration**: Added "Change API Token..." menu item

- **AppKit** integration for macOS-specific features

## Security Improvements

1. API token is never stored in plain text in the source code
2. Token stored in Application Support with restricted file permissions (0o600)
3. Token validation before storage
4. No hardcoded credentials in source code
5. Token file only readable by the user who owns it

## User Experience Improvements

1. First-launch experience with token setup
2. Clear visual feedback for all actions
3. Consistent design language throughout
4. Native macOS look and feel
